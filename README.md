# Bib Racer Recognition

This project is trying to detect the bib numbers from race photos of a sports activity event, as well as recognize the faces, i.e. the racers, in the photos, and eventually match and group the faces with those bib numbers.  It should be able to automate the racer tagging task, according to the bib numbers.
